Player starts at green, progresses by changing perspective to the purple button.
Player should activate the button at the perspective that makes the ball appear
to sit at the top of the "slope" made up of staggered cubes. The ball rolls onto
the purple cube, pushing the red block up to replace the green one. The player
then makes his way back to where the green block used to be to clear the level.
